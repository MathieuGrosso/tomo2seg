this is a living list of things that i realize that i can improve during development

[general]
implement pixel-wise weighted jaccard2 loss

[data-management]
todo2: v2 of the sequence generator to get the entire area (or not)
dtype = "uint8"  # todo remove the cast inside the generator?

[metadata]
mirrored_strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()  # todo add strategy to metadata
batch per replica
str(model_paths.autosaved_model_path) + ".hdf5",  # todo move this to inside ModelPaths 
LR schedule + to the history

[analysis]
add variation_of_information to my metrics notebook   [link] function skimage.metrics.variation_of_information() on skimage

[viz]

[training]
make the history object continue where it stopped
    find the epoch that the training stopped at

[to-cleanup]
todo2: v2 of the sequence generator to get the entire area with random crops
    - and probability of rejecting a crop gven by a function
todo3: predict the whole validation volume
    - remember to declar the aggregation strategy somewhere
todo4: measure some metrics with it
    - volume fraction estimation
    - error blobs
        - FP
        - FN
        - both
        - blob stats
            - min area
            - max area
            - count
            - box dimensions
                - longest length
                - cubic direction
        note:
    - batch size
    - image size
    - n channels
- n crops

todo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
also save crop predictions so that i can compare models that might have different cropping schemes

# todo add links to the files to notebooks to inspect results?

# todo plot image samples in training

validation_steps=100,  # todo put in summary

# todo add metrics 
# todo add wandb?
# todo add analysis in the end, see examples of classif
# todo add callbacks that generate classif examples
# todo print line that I can cccv on the experiments spreadsheet
# todo save the yaml file
# todo (later): separate the analysis part in a separate script so it 
#  can be called at any time with another model
# todo experiment with CentralStorageStrategy?

todo notify me if the training breaks or finishes
    epochs=30,  # todo put this in variable
    callbacks=cb,  # todo mention in summary...
        use_multiprocessing=False,   # todo add to summary
        

    data_hists_per_label_global_prop.append(
        # todo correct this to use shape
        label_data_hist_t.numpy() / 500**3
    )
    
todo do something to materialize or document the bins used in the histograms    

todo compute using keras background so i can put this in the model
todo make option to save crop predictions so i can compare models without the aggregation method
