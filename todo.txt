this is a living list of things that i realize that i can improve during development

[general]
implement pixel-wise weighted jaccard2 loss

[data-management]
todo2: v2 of the sequence generator to get the entire area (or not)
dtype = "uint8"  # todo remove the cast inside the generator?

[metadata]
mirrored_strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()  # todo add strategy to metadata

[analysis]

[viz]


[to-cleanup]
todo1: predict the whole slices with the 3x3 crops
todo2: v2 of the sequence generator to get the entire area (or not)
todo3: predict the whole validation volume
    - remember to declar the aggregation strategy somewhere
todo4: measure some metrics with it
    - volume fraction estimation
    - error blobs
        - FP
        - FN
        - both
        - blob stats
            - min area
            - max area
            - count
            - box dimensions
                - longest length
                - cubic direction
        note:
    - batch size
    - image size
    - n channels
- n crops

todo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
also save crop predictions so that i can compare models that might have different cropping schemes
